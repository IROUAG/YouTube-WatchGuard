# YouTube WatchGuard

**YouTube WatchGuard** is an open-source browser extension designed to help users manage and limit their YouTube watching time. By setting a daily limit, users can be more conscious about their time spent on the platform. Once the daily limit is reached, the extension prevents further access to YouTube for the day, encouraging a healthier online lifestyle.

This extension is available for both Chrome and Firefox:

- [Chrome Web Store](#)
- [Firefox Add-ons](#)

*Note: Replace `#` with the actual links to the extension on both stores.*

## Features

- Set a daily watching limit for YouTube.
- Monitor the amount of time spent on YouTube in real-time.
- Automatically block access to YouTube once the daily limit is reached.
- Pause and resume the timer at any point.
